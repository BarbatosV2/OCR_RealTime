# OCR (Optical Character Recognition)

# Use Cases

ocr_camera is for real time character recognition using camera feed.

ocr_screen is for real time character recognition using screen feed.

ocr_capture also use screen feed for character recognition but I add a feature that is able to capture the words and save it in the txt file which can be later use in other different purposes.
